# Reptilian Redemption Unity 3D


## Synopsis
In Reptilian Redemption, play as a pet lizard and fight off giant spiders to find your way to the mothership and reunite with your reptilian overlords! 

## Motivation
This game was developed in C# using Unity for the Virtual Reality and 3D Games at The University of Salford. I had fun developing it and hope to release more soon!
